## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses Python's `json` module to persist contacts locally  
- CLI-based menu system routes the user to the selected operation  
- Each interaction includes **validation** and **duplicate detection**  
- If `Contacts.json` is missing, it is created automatically

## 🧪 Sample Output

```bash
Contacts in the phonebook:
Name: John   Surname: Doe   Number: 555-1234
Name: Jane   Surname: Smith Number: 555-5678
