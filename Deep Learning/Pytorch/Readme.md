🧠 Food Image Classifier – Performance Optimization & Explainability

🔍 Problem Statement

In large-scale food distribution and packaging environments, errors in visual classification (e.g. Taquito vs Taco) can lead to:

❌ Mislabeled shipments

📦 Packaging errors

🚚 Logistics inefficiencies

📉 QA/Compliance risks

With increasing demand for real-time automation, food tech operations require accurate, explainable, and robust image classification models.
