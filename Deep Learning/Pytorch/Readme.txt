🍲 Performance Optimization of a Neural Network for Food Image Classification

This project presents a complete pipeline for building a high-performing image classification system tailored for the food industry. Using EfficientNet and modern best practices in deep learning, the solution is designed to classify food items with high precision across multiple categories.

🎯 Objective

To develop a robust food image classifier by:

Applying transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0.

Using data augmentation and regularization techniques.

Employing early stopping, model checkpointing, and performance analysis to optimize training.

🧠 Key Technologies

EfficientNet-B0 via timm for transfer learning.

PyTorch for model development and training.

Data Augmentation (color jitter, resizing, cropping).

Early Stopping and checkpointing for training stability.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix.

🧪 Dataset

Custom dataset of high-resolution food images.

Three subsets: train, val, test.

Preprocessing includes normalization and augmentation.

Dataset integrity checks and visualization included.

📊 Results

Metric	Value
Test Accuracy	82%
F1-score (macro)	~0.81
Anomaly Noted (Class)	Taquito (~64%)
Model Used	EfficientNet-B0
Optimizations	Augmentation, LR tuning, Dropout, EarlyStopping

🔍 The model performs well overall but shows lower performance on the 'Taquito' class — a potential candidate for data resampling or targeted augmentation.
