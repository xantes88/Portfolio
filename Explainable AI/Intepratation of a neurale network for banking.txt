Project Details
Phase 1: Using a Pre-Trained Classification Model

Model: A pre-trained model, such as DenseNet from the torchvision library, will be used.

Dataset: The model will be applied to an image dataset, such as MNIST, to explore its classification decisions.

Phase 2: Generating Saliency Maps

XAI Techniques: Techniques such as Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, and Occlusion Maps will be implemented to generate the model’s saliency maps.

Phase 3: Final Report

Dataset Description: The report will provide details on the origin, structure, and characteristics of the dataset used.

Saliency Maps Analysis: Saliency maps for correct and incorrect classes will be compared to identify and understand model errors.



Project Objectives
Understanding the Model: The project aims to use XAI techniques to gain an in-depth understanding of the inner workings of the pre-trained model.

Decision Visualization: It seeks to clearly and interpretably visualize which elements influence the model’s decisions through saliency maps.

Error Identification: The project will analyze saliency maps to identify and understand model errors, distinguishing between correct and incorrect classifications.
