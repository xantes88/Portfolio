💼 Executive Summary

Financial institutions increasingly rely on AI to process visual documents (e.g. cheques, IDs, contracts), but traditional deep learning models lack interpretability — creating risks in compliance and auditing. This project simulates a robust Explainable AI (XAI) framework that demystifies CNN predictions using Integrated Gradients, GradCAM, LIME, and other techniques, adapted to financial operations.

Using a transformed MNIST dataset as a synthetic proxy for document images, we evaluate model trust, simulate human-in-the-loop validation, and estimate cost reductions tied to explainability.

🔍 Business Use Case

Sector: Banking, Fintech, RegTech

Scenario: AI model automates visual document validation (e.g., fraud detection)

Problem: CNN models offer high accuracy, but zero transparency

Risk: Regulatory penalties, lack of auditability, operational delays

✅ Strategic Solution

Train custom CNN on RGB-transformed MNIST (simulated document input)

Apply multiple XAI methods (Captum, GradCAM, LIME)

Compare correct vs. incorrect predictions using saliency heatmaps

Simulate trust layer for auditor-friendly model output
