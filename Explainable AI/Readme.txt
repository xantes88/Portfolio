📊 Explainable AI for Banking Compliance

Transparent Neural Risk Scoring with CNN + Integrated Gradients / LIME / GradCAM

💼 Executive Summary

In highly regulated sectors such as banking and insurance, model decisions must be not only accurate but explainable. This project simulates a compliance risk scoring scenario using a neural network and multiple explainability layers. The objective: deliver transparency, build trust, and support regulatory alignment through visual and interpretable AI.

🔍 Business Scenario

👨‍💼 Industry: Banking & Financial Services
📋 Use Case: Credit Scoring / AML Compliance / Internal Audit
🧩 Challenge: Most AI models are black boxes
⚖️ Regulatory Need: Explainable predictions under frameworks like GDPR, Basel III, ECB AI guidelines

✅ Solution

An interpretable deep learning pipeline that:

Classifies observations into multiple risk classes (simulated via digit classes 0–9)

Applies Integrated Gradients, LIME, GradCAM, and Occlusion

Provides both local (per case) and global (model-level) explanations

Visualizes key drivers via saliency maps and heatmaps

💡 Value Generated

✅ Brings explainability to neural networks
✅ Supports regulatory audits and model validation
✅ Enables safer adoption of AI in compliance and finance workflows
✅ Demonstrates transferable methodology for real-world datasets

📊 Aligns with regulatory pressure for interpretable AI

🧾 Dataset Disclaimer

Note: The dataset used is MNIST, publicly available and unrelated to real customers. The project is a methodological simulation of an explainable classification system in a regulated context. All techniques used are transferable to real banking datasets.

🔮 Future Integrations

✅ SHAP-based feature ranking

✅ Deployment on real transaction or credit data

📊 Power BI integration for audit dashboards

🧠 LLMs for natural language explanation summaries

🧩 Full XAI + Risk Scoring pipeline deployable via API

🧠 Takeaway

Even complex neural networks can become explainable with the right tools. This project proves that XAI techniques can bridge the gap between model performance and business trust — paving the way for safe AI adoption in finance and compliance.
