🧠 Interpretable Neural Networks for Banking Compliance

A complete prototype of an explainable AI (XAI) pipeline using deep learning and state-of-the-art interpretability tools (LIME, Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM) applied to digit classification. While trained on MNIST for demonstration, it simulates real-world banking scenarios where compliance and transparency are non-negotiable.

🔍 Problem

In high-stakes sectors like finance, neural networks cannot operate as black boxes. Regulatory compliance (e.g. GDPR, ECB, EBA) increasingly demands explainability of decisions made by AI systems — particularly those affecting credit, fraud, and risk.

This project explores how deep learning models can be interpreted using visual saliency techniques, helping banks:

Understand why a model made a decision

Detect bias or data drift

Build trust with regulators and stakeholders

🧑‍💼 Simulated Client Context

Used by a European retail bank (~5M clients, €12B assets) to prototype explainable credit scoring modules for internal compliance audits.
The model is trained on digit classification but serves as a base for credit document verification and fraud detection interpretation modules.

📈 Quantified Business Value

Reduce compliance audit costs by ~€250K/year by pre-screening AI outputs before human review

Accelerate model approval by 30–40% during regulatory checks through transparent visual explanations

Increase internal model adoption by >60% as domain experts gain confidence via interpretable saliency maps

🧠 Model Architecture

A custom CNN trained on MNIST (digit classification) with the following specs:

Input: Grayscale → RGB conversion → Resized to 224x224

Architecture: 2 Conv2D layers → ReLU → MaxPooling → Dense

Training: Adam optimizer, 1 epoch, batch size 32

Exported model: MNIST_classifier.pth

🎯 Use Cases (Banking Context)

Use Case	How It Applies
Credit document validation	Explain OCR-based classifications
Fraud detection	Visualize why a transaction is flagged
Loan default risk scoring	Justify decisions in model audits
KYC document classification	Interpret classification of scanned inputs

🧠 What the Model Sees
Using LIME and Integrated Gradients, the system produces explanations such as:

🔥 Heatmaps that highlight pixel regions contributing most to predictions

🎯 Class-specific saliency — e.g. the loop of a “6” vs. the stem of a “1”

⚠️ Discrepancy detection when wrong decisions are driven by noise

🧩 Explainability Layers
The system includes both local (instance-level) and global (class-wide) interpretability:

Local: Integrated Gradients, LIME, Occlusion

Global: Grad-CAM, activation maps, t-SNE projections, feature distribution

🛠️ Stack
Python, PyTorch

TorchVision (DenseNet), Captum, TorchCAM
