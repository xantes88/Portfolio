Improving Image-Based Threat Detection for Critical Infrastructure Security
Problem Statement:
Existing models based on limited datasets struggle to detect anomalies or potential threats in images with the required precision. This compromises the company's ability to respond and mitigate emergencies, posing risks to operational continuity and security.

Objective:
Enhance the capacity to promptly identify critical objects and behaviors in images to strengthen the resilience and safety of managed critical infrastructures.

Proposed Solution:

Data Augmentation:
Generate image and text variants using generative models to increase dataset diversity and better capture edge cases, enhancing model training for improved anomaly detection.

Advanced Image Captioning:
Apply sophisticated image captioning techniques to develop a robust dataset of image descriptions, facilitating better context understanding by AI models.

Model Enhancement:
Train a custom image recognition model using the OxfordIIITPet dataset and augmented datasets to improve detection performance for critical elements. Employ early stopping and performance evaluation methods to optimize results.

Performance Evaluation:
Compare model effectiveness on both original and augmented datasets using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and anomaly detection rates to assess the real-world applicability.

Continuous Improvement:
Implement a feedback loop for model retraining using new data from detected incidents, further improving detection capabilities.

Key Goals:

Strengthen image recognition systems for critical security tasks.
Ensure prompt detection of threats to maintain operational security and infrastructure resilience.
Foster adaptability in AI models to emerging threats and diverse operational environments.
This approach will improve threat detection accuracy, supporting the organization's mission to safeguard critical infrastructures efficiently and proactively.
