⚙️ Data Augmentation for Power Plant Safety

Synthetic Data Generation to Boost Safety Classifiers in Industrial Settings  


---

## 💼 Executive Summary  

Industrial safety systems often lack sufficient labeled data, especially for rare but critical incidents (e.g., equipment failure, personnel risk).  
This project addresses the **class imbalance problem** by generating synthetic training images through **generative augmentation techniques**, improving the robustness of safety classifiers in simulated industrial environments.
