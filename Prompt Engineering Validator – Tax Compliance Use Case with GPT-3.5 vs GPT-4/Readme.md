## üß† Executive Summary

Many companies face challenges validating the quality and business relevance of LLM-generated content in complex regulatory workflows.  
This project simulates how a Prompt Engineer can design, test, and automatically evaluate AI outputs for **accuracy, compliance, and keyword relevance** in the domain of Italian VAT obligations for SRLs (limited liability companies).

We implemented a dual-model evaluation pipeline using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, enriched by a tailored keyword matching algorithm and output diagnostics, to objectively measure content quality.

### üî∑ GPT-4 Output

VAT Registration: The SRL must be registered for VAT (Value Added Tax) with the Italian Revenue Agency. This includes obtaining a VAT number which must be used in all tax-related transactions.

VAT Reporting: The company must prepare and submit periodic VAT returns (monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the company's turnover) to the Italian tax authorities, detailing all taxable transactions carried out during the period.

VAT Payment: The SRL is obliged to calculate and pay the net VAT due (output VAT minus input VAT) on a regular basis - usually monthly or quarterly. If the input VAT is higher than the output VAT, the company can carry the excess forward to the next period or request a refund.

Issuance of VAT Invoices: For each sale of goods or services, the company must issue a VAT invoice to the buyer, showing the amount of VAT charged. The invoice must comply with the requirements of the Italian VAT law.

Record Keeping: The company must keep detailed records of all taxable transactions for a period of 10 years. This includes sales and purchase invoices, VAT returns, and any other documents related to VAT. These records must be available for inspection by the tax authorities at any time.
