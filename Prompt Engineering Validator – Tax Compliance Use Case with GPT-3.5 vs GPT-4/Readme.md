# ü§ñ Prompt Evaluation System for Business Use Cases (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)

_A simulated AI project benchmarking GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tax compliance prompt evaluation with automated relevance scoring._

## üß† Executive Summary

Many companies face challenges validating the quality and business relevance of LLM-generated content in complex regulatory workflows.  
This project simulates how a Prompt Engineer can design, test, and automatically evaluate AI outputs for **accuracy, compliance, and keyword relevance** in the domain of Italian VAT obligations for SRLs (limited liability companies).

We implemented a dual-model evaluation pipeline using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, enriched by a tailored keyword matching algorithm and output diagnostics, to objectively measure content quality.

## üì• Real Model Outputs & Evaluation

### üîπ GPT-3.5-Turbo Output

- Charging VAT on sales of goods or services at the standard rate of 22%.  
- Issuing invoices that comply with the Italian VAT regulations.  
- Submitting periodic VAT returns (usually monthly or quarterly).  
- Keeping proper VAT records and documentation for at least 10 years.  
- Complying with Intrastat reporting requirements for intra-EU trade.

**Evaluation:**  
- Word count: 55  
- Keyword match: 2/5  
- Relevance: ‚ùå Low  

---

### üî∑ GPT-4 Output

1. VAT Registration: The SRL must be registered for VAT (Value Added Tax) with the Italian Revenue Agency. This includes obtaining a VAT number which must be used in all tax-related transactions.

2. VAT Reporting: The company must prepare and submit periodic VAT returns (monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the company's turnover) to the Italian tax authorities, detailing all taxable transactions carried out during the period.

3. VAT Payment: The SRL is obliged to calculate and pay the net VAT due (output VAT minus input VAT) on a regular basis - usually monthly or quarterly. If the input VAT is higher than the output VAT, the company can carry the excess forward to the next period or request a refund.

4. Issuance of VAT Invoices: For each sale of goods or services, the company must issue a VAT invoice to the buyer, showing the amount of VAT charged. The invoice must comply with the requirements of the Italian VAT law.

5. Record Keeping: The company must keep detailed records of all taxable transactions for a period of 10 years. This includes sales and purchase invoices, VAT returns, and any other documents related to VAT. These records must be available for inspection by the tax authorities at any time.

**Evaluation:**  
- Word count: 209  
- Keyword match: 3/5  
- Relevance: ‚úÖ Sufficient

## üåü Expanded Use Cases & Future Developments

### Expanded Use Cases

This prompt evaluation framework can be extended beyond Italian VAT compliance to various domains where accuracy, compliance, and relevancy of LLM outputs are critical, such as:

- **Financial Reporting & Forecasting:** Automating the generation and validation of financial summaries and forecasts to assist CFOs and finance teams.  
- **Legal Document Analysis:** Supporting contract review and legal compliance checks by assessing the relevance and completeness of AI-generated summaries or clauses.  
- **Regulatory Risk Management:** Continuously evaluating AI outputs for adherence to industry regulations in sectors like banking, healthcare, and insurance.  
- **Customer Support Automation:** Ensuring chatbot or virtual assistant responses align with company policies and provide accurate, compliant information.  
- **Training & Onboarding:** Using prompt evaluation to build reliable AI tutors that provide consistent, accurate training materials in complex subjects.

### Potential Future Developments

- **Multi-language Support:** Extending prompt evaluation to support multiple languages, broadening applicability across global markets.  
- **Advanced Semantic Scoring:** Integrating NLP techniques like semantic similarity and entailment checks to complement keyword matching.  
- **User Interface Development:** Building an interactive dashboard for non-technical users to submit prompts, view outputs, and get automatic evaluations.  
- **Continuous Learning Pipelines:** Creating feedback loops where user validation improves prompt design and model selection over time.  
- **Integration with Enterprise Systems:** Connecting this framework with ERP or compliance software (e.g., SAP, Oracle) for end-to-end automation.  
- **Explainability Modules:** Adding explainable AI components to highlight why certain outputs scored higher or lower, increasing trust and auditability.
