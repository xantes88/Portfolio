# ü§ñ Prompt Evaluation System for Business Use Cases (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)

_A simulated AI project benchmarking GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tax compliance prompt evaluation with automated relevance scoring._

---

## üß† Executive Summary

Many companies struggle to validate the **business relevance** and **regulatory accuracy** of LLM-generated content.  
This project simulates how a **Prompt Engineer** can build an evaluation pipeline to automatically score, compare, and improve AI-generated outputs ‚Äî using a real-world example: **VAT compliance for Italian SRLs (limited liability companies)**.

By combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with a keyword-matching evaluation system, we generate outputs, score them against business-critical keywords, and assess relevance and completeness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Prompt execution with both **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4**
- Keyword-based **automated scoring system**
- Detailed output diagnostics: word count, keyword match, relevance level
- LangChain interface for **production-grade modularity**
- Fallback logic for GPT-4 access issues
- Designed for **rapid iteration of prompts and evaluation criteria**

## üß™ Prompt Example

```
You are an Italian tax expert. Briefly list the main VAT obligations for an SRL (limited liability company) under the standard tax regime in 2024. Reply with 5 concise bullet points.
```

## üì§ Model Outputs & Evaluation

### üîπ GPT-3.5 Output

- Register for VAT with the Italian Revenue Agency  
- Issue VAT invoices for all taxable transactions  
- File periodic VAT returns and pay any VAT due  
- Maintain proper VAT accounting records  
- Comply with VAT rules for intra-EU transactions

**Evaluation:**
- Word count: 52  
- Keyword match: 3/9  
- Relevance: ‚ö†Ô∏è Borderline

### üî∑ GPT-4 Output

1. VAT Registration: The SRL must register for VAT and obtain a VAT number from the Italian Revenue Agency.  
2. VAT Returns: Regular VAT filings are required (monthly or quarterly depending on turnover).  
3. VAT Payment: Companies must calculate and pay VAT within the prescribed deadlines.  
4. VAT Invoicing: For each transaction, a compliant VAT invoice must be issued.  
5. Record Keeping: All relevant records must be stored for a minimum of 10 years.

**Evaluation:**
- Word count: 165  
- Keyword match: 7/9  
- Relevance: ‚úÖ Sufficient
