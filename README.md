# 👤 Federico Petillo — Business Operations Meets Data Automation

## 🎯 From SAP Finance Execution to AI-Powered Optimization

With 5+ years in SAP-driven Accounts Payable, vendor lifecycle management, and shared services operations (DXC Technology, IQ-EQ), I’ve seen how slow, manual workflows block real business value.

Now, I design AI & BI solutions that:

- 💸 Automate repetitive tasks (invoice processing, vendor check, exception handling)
- 🔍 Predict risks before they hit — late payments, compliance gaps, bottlenecks
- 📊 Generate dashboards aligned with finance KPIs and decision-maker needs
