# 👤 Federico Petillo — AI-Driven Finance Automation Specialist

## 🎯 From SAP Finance Execution to AI-Powered Optimization

With 5+ years in SAP-driven Accounts Payable, vendor lifecycle management, and shared services operations (DXC Technology, IQ-EQ), I’ve witnessed how slow, manual workflows block real business value.

Now, I design AI & BI solutions that:

- 💸 Automate repetitive tasks like invoice processing, vendor checks, and exception handling  
- 🔍 Predict risks early — late payments, compliance gaps, operational bottlenecks  
- 📊 Generate dashboards aligned with finance KPIs and decision-maker needs  

These projects are simulations built on realistic data and scenarios, demonstrating the potential of AI to improve cash flow management, reduce errors, and save thousands of labor hours annually.
