👤 Federico Petillo — From Finance Ops to AI-Driven Process Optimization

↺ Strategic Career Shift: From Execution to Intelligence

With 5+ years leading Accounts Payable operations at DXC Technology and a Management degree from Bocconi University, I experienced firsthand the inefficiencies of manual, rule-based financial processes.

That's why I pivoted.Today, I build intelligent systems — not just dashboards or scripts — but tools that automate decisions, generate insights, and adapt to real-world uncertainty.
