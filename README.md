# 💼 Federico Petillo — AI & Data Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio.

I come from a background in **accounts payable and financial operations**, with nearly 5 years of experience at DXC Technology. Today, I’m transitioning into a role that combines this operational expertise with **artificial intelligence and machine learning**, focused on delivering **measurable business value** through data-driven automation and intelligent systems.

## 🧭 Why This Portfolio?

This portfolio showcases my hands-on capabilities in:
- AI project delivery using **Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Streamlit**
- Building explainable, production-oriented models
- Designing solutions around real-world use cases in **finance, logistics, and agritech**

My projects are not academic exercises — they simulate actual business problems, propose automated solutions, and quantify potential economic impact.

## 🔄 Career Pivot: From Finance Ops to AI Engineering

While working in accounts payable, I saw firsthand how **manual and repetitive** many financial processes are — and how little insight businesses extract from their own data. This sparked a career shift:

> Instead of just executing financial processes, I now design intelligent systems that **optimize, automate, and explain them.**

I’ve formalized this transition with:
- IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
- Microsoft AI Engineering Specialization
- Hands-on AI projects solving **real business bottlenecks**
