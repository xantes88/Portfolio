👤 Federico Petillo — Turning Financial Operations into Intelligent Automation

🎯 From Accounts Payable to Applied AI
After 5 years optimizing financial pipelines at DXC Technology and a Management degree from Bocconi, I witnessed how much time, money, and insight companies lose due to manual workflows, poor data visibility, and decision inertia.

So I pivoted — from repetitive execution to intelligent systems that act, learn, and explain.

Now I build ML solutions that:

Automate decisions

Deliver tangible business value

Earn stakeholder trust through explainability

🚀 I Don’t Build Dashboards. I Build Outcomes.
Every project in this portfolio tackles a real-world use case.
No toy datasets. No academic fluff. Just business value, translated into code.
