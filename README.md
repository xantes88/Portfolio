# 👤 Federico Petillo — Business Operations Meets Data Automation

## 🎯 From Finance Execution to Scalable Optimization

With 5+ years of experience managing SAP-based operations in Accounts Payable, HR, and vendor reconciliation (DXC Technology, IQ-EQ), I’ve seen how inefficient workflows, repetitive tasks, and poor data visibility hold companies back.

That’s why I transitioned from **operating** the process — to **improving** it with automation, analytics, and explainability.

Now I design Python tools that:

- ✅ Automate routine workflows  
- ✅ Improve decision accuracy with real-time insights  
- ✅ Align technical solutions with business KPIs
