# 👤 Federico Petillo — Business Operations Meets Data Automation

## 🎯 From Finance Execution to Scalable Optimization

With 5+ years of experience managing SAP-based operations in Accounts Payable, HR, and vendor reconciliation (DXC Technology, IQ-EQ), I’ve seen how inefficient workflows, repetitive tasks, and poor data visibility hold companies back.

That’s why I transitioned from **operating** the process — to **improving** it with automation, analytics, and explainability.

🛠 Now I Design Intelligent Tools That:
✅ Automate routine and repetitive workflows across finance and operations

✅ Improve decision accuracy through real-time insights and risk prediction

✅ Align technical solutions with key business KPIs and strategic goals

✅ Build robust dashboards and machine learning models ready for production or advanced analysis

✅ Deliver impact where it matters: cash flow optimization, operational efficiency, and compliance visibility
