👤 Federico Petillo — From Finance Ops to AI-Driven Business Systems
🔁 Strategic Career Shift: From Execution to Intelligence
After 5 years managing and optimizing financial operations (AP, HR, payroll) in international environments — including nearly 3 years at DXC Technology — I saw the limits of manual processes, inefficiencies, and legacy tools.

That’s why I pivoted.
With a Management degree from Bocconi University, complemented by advanced AI and Data Science training, I now design intelligent systems that automate decisions, extract value from data, and adapt to real-world business dynamics.

💡 What I Bring to the Table
🔍 Deep business process insight from hands-on financial operations

🧠 AI systems built with explainability, compliance, and ROI in mind

💬 Clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders

🚀 Agile mindset focused on delivering working prototypes fast
