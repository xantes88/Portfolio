I'm a professional with a strong background in finance and operations.

After years of experience in multinational environments (DXC Technology, IQ-EQ, Università Bocconi), I decided to redirect my analytical mindset and process-driven approach towards **AI engineering**.


I'm currently sharpening my skills in:

- 🧠 Deep Learning (CV, NLP,Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning)
- 📊 Data Science & Predictive Modeling
- ⚙️ MLOps and scalable AI pipelines
- 🔗 Bridging technical models with business value

All my projects aim to deliver **concrete impact**, whether it’s automating classification tasks, predicting housing prices, or simulating defensive AI agents for cybersecurity.

### 📌 My mission:
To join a high-impact AI or Data team where I can contribute from day one — with both technical skills and strategic thinking.
