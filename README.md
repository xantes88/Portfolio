# 👤 Federico Petillo — AI-Driven Finance Automation Specialist  
🎯 From SAP Execution to Predictive Control | Python • Power BI • Prompt Engineering

## 🚀 Executive Summary  

I’ve spent 5+ years inside SAP-driven Finance Ops (DXC Technology, IQ-EQ), dealing with blocked invoices, vendor escalations, and inefficient workflows.  
Now I build systems that simulate the next evolution of finance operations: **AI-powered, risk-aware, and KPI-aligned**.

I bridge the gap between **slow enterprise processes and fast AI solutions** — combining Finance acumen, Process Logic, and full-stack AI development.

My portfolio focuses on high-leverage solutions:
- 🧠 **Prompt Engineering** for compliance, automation and enterprise LLM use cases  
- 💸 **Late payment forecasting** and AP process optimization  
- 📊 **Business dashboards** in Power BI for KPI and risk tracking  
- 🎨 **Generative AI pipelines** to simulate rare events and boost model robustness  
- 🔍 **Explainability-first models** for regulated or auditable environments
