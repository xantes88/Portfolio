👤 Federico Petillo — From Finance Ops to AI-Driven Optimization

🧭 The Shift: From Financial Ops to Smart Automation

After 5 years in finance operations — leading AP, payroll, and vendor management at DXC Technology and other top-tier environments — I saw the same thing over and over:
Repetitive work, costly delays, and systems that think as little as possible.

So I made a move.

With a Bocconi degree in Management and new training in AI Engineering & Data Science, I now design intelligent systems that don’t just report — they decide.

🚀 I Don’t Build Dashboards. I Build Outcomes.
Every project in this portfolio tackles a real-world use case.
No toy datasets. No academic fluff. Just business value, translated into code.
