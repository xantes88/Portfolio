# ðŸ§  Fruit Classification with Ensemble Learning

A robust ML system that classifies exotic fruits using advanced preprocessing, feature scaling, class balancing (SMOTE), and ensemble models like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Business Use Case

Designed for simulation in a **mid-size export company** handling ~2M fruit shipments/year.  
The model automates quality sorting at warehouse level using batch data (e.g., weight, diameter, sweetness).

Before automation, **manual visual inspection led to 5â€“8% misclassification**, impacting both compliance and client satisfaction.  
This system uses ML to simulate a consistent and automated classification process.

## ðŸ’° Business Value 

âœ… **~â‚¬20K/year saved** by catching misclassifications before shipment (based on 1% error reduction across 2M units)  
âœ… Sorting **precision improved to 88.7%**, especially on visually similar classes  
âœ… Saves ~200 hours/year in **manual classification** (estimated 30 seconds per sample for 50,000 checked units)  
âœ… Enables better batch forecasting through consistent digital logs
