ðŸ§  Fruit Classification with Ensemble Learning

A robust ML system that classifies exotic fruits using advanced preprocessing, feature scaling, class balancing (SMOTE), and ensemble models like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

ðŸ“¦ Business Use-Case

Used by a mid-size exporter with ~2M annual fruit shipments to automate quality sorting at the warehouse level.
Before implementation, visual inspection errors led to 5â€“8% misclassification, impacting both compliance and customer satisfaction.

ðŸ’° Business Value

âœ… Reduces return costs by up to â‚¬20K/year by catching misclassified shipments early.

âœ… Improves sorting precision to 88.7%, reducing false classification between visually similar fruits.

âœ… Saves ~200 hours/year in manual quality control through automated predictions.

âœ… Enables better forecasting by generating consistent classification logs per batch.
