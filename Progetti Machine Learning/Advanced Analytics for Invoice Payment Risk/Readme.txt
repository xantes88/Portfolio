📊 Advanced Analytics for Invoice Payment Risk
Proactive Invoice Monitoring with Machine Learning, SHAP & SAP-like Simulation

Predict which vendor invoices are at risk of late payment and prioritize action before financial damage occurs.

💼 Executive Summary
Companies lose substantial amounts monthly due to late invoice payments. This project simulates a real-world Shared Services Center environment using SAP-like invoice fields (e.g., gl_code, company_code, vendor_region, invoice_block_reason) and develops a machine learning-based risk detection system.

Leveraging predictive analytics, explainable AI (SHAP), and Power BI reporting, it enables proactive intervention and cash flow optimization — detecting payment risks before due dates.

🔍 Business Scenario
🧾 Company Profile

Mid-sized enterprise with 5 business units processing 50,000+ invoices annually

AP team of 6 managing SAP workflows across multiple vendor regions

Common challenges: blocked invoices, missing POs, delayed vendor responses

🚨 Problem

Approximately 20% of invoices are paid late

Lost early payment discounts and penalties totaling around €1.2M/year

Manual invoice reviews are time-consuming and lack clear risk visibility

✅ Solution
This project builds a machine learning classifier to flag at-risk invoices before the due date and assign a priority_action. Sample output:

invoice_id	vendor_name	risk_score	priority_action
145	Vendor IT S.p.A	0.82	Immediate Reminder
288	Office Srl	0.77	Monitor – Response Delay
391	General Maint.	0.35	Low Risk – No Action

💰 Estimated ROI – Simulation
📊 Annual Impact:

50,000 invoices/year × 20% late = 10,000 at risk

If 12% of these are corrected → 6,000 timely payments

Average saving per invoice = €80 (discounts, penalties, workload)

💸 €480,000/year recovered (improved cash flow + avoided penalties)

🔧 Features & Pipeline
✅ SAP-like Fields: gl_code, company_code, vendor_region, invoice_block_reason, payment_term

📈 Modeling: Random Forest & XGBoost with SMOTE balancing and Stratified K-Fold validation

🧠 Explainability: SHAP summary plots for transparent model interpretation

📊 Power BI Dashboard: Vendor risk KPIs, regional views, and actionable alert tracking

🔁 Retraining Logic: Supports auto-retrain when new_data.csv is provided

🛠️ Deployment-ready Outputs: CSV files with alerts and KPIs for operational use

🧠 Workflow
Data Simulation of 1,000+ invoices with realistic SAP-like fields

Feature Engineering including urgency scores, overdue flags, and vendor risk history

Model Training using SMOTE for class balance and cross-validation for robustness

Explainability with SHAP for both Random Forest and XGBoost

Output Generation: Risk scores, priority actions, and dashboards in CSV format

Retraining Block for continuous learning (if new_data: retrain())
